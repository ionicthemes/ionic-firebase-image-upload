## Upload Images to Firebase Storage from your Ionic app

<!-- There are a variety of options available for storing data, and choosing the right one will depend on your application needs, your expertise, and resources.

Firebase offers Cloud Firestore which is a flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database that is very easy to use with an Ionic app.

This repo is an Ionic demo app of a Contacts CRUD build with Firebase.

We suggest you to read the companion tutorial that explains all the steps needed in order to [set up a Firestore database and connect it with your Ionic application](https://ionicthemes.com/tutorials/add-a-firebase-database-to-your-ionic-app) in order to save and fetch data.

If you are looking for an Ionic Starter App with Firestore integration ready to go, you should check [Ionic Full Starter App - PRO](https://ionicthemes.com/templates/ionic5-full-starter-app-pro-version).  It includes many examples and use cases of data handling using Ionic and Firebase.
